# Lovely-EncryptionDecryption
This is a custom encryption and decryption set of programs that was originally made for my girlfriend for our 3 year anniversary. </br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;( PLEASE feel free too use for whatever, but it can get you brownie points ;) )</br>
That is why all of the ASCII hearts exist. It is meant to be used for love-y purposes.</br>
___________________
You can input either line-separated file of items to encrypt, or just 1 item from the command line to manually type in.

"encrypt.cpp" will output an enrypted line-separated file or just the 1 item output, again depending on what the user chooses.
"decrypt.cpp" will take in an encoded message from the user, then will decrypt it into English.

This was a quicker side-project that I needed to develop my own 2-way encryption/decryption for. Hashing was considered, but I quickly remembered that it was not going to be useful in my case, due to it's 1-way nature.</br></br>
For my own personal use, I had created a list of these virtual love letter messages that were encrypted, scheduled them for each day by email, then for each day my girlfriend could use the compiled decrypt.cpp program to decrypt each message per day. We both thought it was clever :>)
